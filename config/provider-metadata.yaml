IP addresses are automatically arranged under parent prefixes within their respective VRFs according to the IP hierarchya.

A single-termination circuit can be used when you don''t know (or care) about the far end of a circuit (for example, an Internet access circuit which connects to a transit provider). A dual-termination circuit is useful for tracking circuits which connect two sites. Each circuit termination is attached to either a site or to a provider network. Site terminations may optionally be connected via a cable to a specific device interface or port within that site. Each termination must be assigned a port speed, and can optionally be assigned an upstream speed if it differs from the downstream speed (a common scenario with e.g. DOCSIS cable modems).

For example, sites are stored in the dcimsite table, which has columns named name, facility, physicaladdress, and so on. As new attributes are added to objects throughout the development of NetBox, tables are expanded to include new rows. However, some users might want to store additional object attributes that are somewhat esoteric in nature, and that would not make sense to include in the core NetBox database schema. For instance, suppose your organization needs to associate each device with a ticket number correlating it with an internal support system record. This is certainly a legitimate use for NetBox, but it''s not a common enough need to warrant including a field for every NetBox installation. Instead, you can create a custom field to hold this data.'

        description: 'From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/rearport/: Like front ports, rear ports are pass-through ports which represent the continuation of a path from one cable to the next. Each rear port is defined with its physical type and a number of positions: Rear ports with more than one position can be mapped to multiple front ports. This can be useful for modeling instances where multiple paths share a common cable (for example, six discrete two-strand fiber connections sharing a 12-strand MPO cable).'

The name and facility ID of each rack within a location must be unique. Rack height is measured in rack units (U); racks are commonly between 42U and 48U tall, but NetBox allows you to define racks of arbitrary height. A toggle is provided to indicate whether rack units are in ascending (from the ground up) or descending order. Each rack is assigned a name and (optionally) a separate facility ID. This is helpful when leasing space in a data center your organization does not own: The facility will often assign a seemingly arbitrary ID to a rack (for example, "M204.313") whereas internally you refer to is simply as "R113." A unique serial number and asset tag may also be associated with each rack.'
