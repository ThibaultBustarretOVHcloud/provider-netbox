          documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/devices/#devices:
          Every piece of hardware which is installed within a site or rack exists
          in NetBox as a device. Devices are measured in rack units (U) and can be
          half depth or full depth. A device may have a height of 0U: These devices
          do not consume vertical rack space and cannot be assigned to a particular
          rack unit. A common example of a 0U device is a vertically-mounted PDU.'
